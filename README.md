# Employee Directory

## Summary

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. This assignment will required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Functionality

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

* Sort the table by at least one category

* Filter the users by at least one property.
